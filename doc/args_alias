When you creating a job, you are passing a list of arguments.
Usually, you want to pass zotonic #context{} record. What to do in this case?

You can use so-called aliases. It is simple. You just need to place atom 
with @-sign in the tail instead of argument.

For example: echo site #context{} record into stdout:

M:	io
F:	format
A:	"~p~n", [context@]

As you can see in console, 'context@' atom will be replaced with #context{} record
of current host.


List of available aliases and values:

 * context@		#context{}. ~result of z:c(current_host).
 * context_sudo@	Result of z_acl:sudo(#context{}).
